*GigaSOM.jl - Huge-scale, high-performance flow cytometry clustering in Julia*
=========

With GigaSOM.jl, our novel contribution will be allowing the analysis of huge-scale clinical studies,
scaling down software limitations. In order to do so, we will implement the parallelization of the FlowSOM algorithm
using HPC and increase the maximum number of cells that can be processed simultaneously by the algorithm.
